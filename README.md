# movies_ratings
My python data analysis of a MovieLens ratings dataset.

This is one of my first data science projects.
In my notebook, I explore and clean the data. After it is finally useable, I try to answer 2 interesting questions:
- Are horror movies, on average, rated higher than comedy movies?
- What is the highest rated genre of movies?

I hope you enjoy reading my data analysis and maybe even learn something from it ;D\n

For this analysis, I used:
- Jupyter Notebooks
- python libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- the website GroupLens, where I got the dataset from (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
